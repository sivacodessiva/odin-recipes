            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

            <li>3–4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 lb (450 g) ground beef or Italian sausage (or lentils/mushrooms for veg version)</li>
            <li>1 can (28 oz / 800 g) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>

            <li>½ tsp chili flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Pasta Layer</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>9–12 lasagna noodles (regular or no-boil)</li>
            <li>Salted water for boiling</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil (to prevent sticking)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Optional Add-Ins</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>1 cup chopped spinach or kale (for layering with cheese)</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>Fresh basil or parsley (for garnish)</li>
        </ol>

        </ol>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce (The Soul):</strong> Heat olive oil in a deep pan. Add chopped onions and sauté until translucent. Add minced garlic and stir till fragrant. Crumble in the ground beef or sausage and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon. Drain excess fat if needed. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and sugar. Let it simmer gently on low heat for at least 20–30 minutes — the longer it simmers, the deeper and richer the flavor. If it thickens too much, splash in a bit of water or stock. Taste and adjust seasoning; it should be slightly salty and sweet, balanced by a savory depth.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture (The Heart):</strong> In a large bowl, mix ricotta, half of the mozzarella, half of the Parmesan, and one beaten egg. Add salt, pepper, and optionally some chopped parsley or spinach. This creamy layer binds the lasagna together and softens the sharpness of the sauce. If you’re using spinach, squeeze it dry so it doesn’t water the layers down. Set aside the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan for the topping later — they’ll form the golden, bubbly crust.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Assemble the Layers (The Structure):</strong> Boil lasagna noodles in salted water until just al dente (a minute less than package time). Drain and lay them flat on parchment paper to prevent sticking. In a baking dish (9x13 inches), spread a thin layer of sauce first to prevent sticking. Then follow this sequence:
                <ul>    
                    <p>(a) a layer of noodles,</p>
                    <p>(b) a layer of the ricotta mixture,</p>
                    <p>(c) a layer of sauce.</p>
                </ul>
                Repeat 2–3 times, finishing with noodles on top. Spread the last of the sauce generously, and cover with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan. Press gently so the layers settle evenly.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Bake and Rest (The Harmony):</strong> Cover the dish with foil (slightly tented so it doesn’t touch the cheese) and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 15–20 minutes until the top is golden and bubbling. Once out of the oven, let it rest for at least 15–20 minutes — this is crucial; the layers set and the flavors meld beautifully. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, slice cleanly, and serve warm.</li>
        </ul>
