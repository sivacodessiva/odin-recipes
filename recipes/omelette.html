        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ol>

        <h3>Eggs — The Foundation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 to 3 large eggs (fresh, room temperature for best fluffiness)</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk or water (optional, for extra softness)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cheese — The Soul</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>¼ to ½ cup shredded cheese (choose any or mix):</li>
            <li>Cheddar for sharpness</li>
            <li>Mozzarella for stretch</li>
            <li>Parmesan for nuttiness</li>
            <li>Feta for tang (optional)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Fat — The Flavor Medium</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter (unsalted preferred for control)</li>
            <li><em>OR</em> 1 teaspoon olive oil if you want lighter texture</li>
            <li><em>Optional:</em> a drop of ghee for a golden aroma</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Optional Add-ons — The Personality Layer</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped onions or scallions</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon bell peppers or mushrooms</li>
            <li>A pinch of chili flakes or herbs (parsley, thyme, chives)</li>
            <li>Small splash of cream for richness (if desired)</li>
        </ol>

        </ol>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whisk the Base (Creating Air and Structure):</strong> Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add salt, pepper, and milk. Whisk briskly using a fork or whisk until frothy — this incorporates air, giving your omelette a light, soufflé-like texture. The mixture should look slightly bubbly and even in color.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Heat and Pour (Controlling Texture):</strong> Place a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add butter and let it melt till it foams lightly (not brown). Pour in the egg mixture and swirl the pan so it spreads evenly. As the edges start to set, tilt the pan and let the uncooked eggs flow underneath — this builds soft, fluffy layers.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Layer the Cheese (The Melting Moment):</strong> Once the surface is slightly set but still glossy, sprinkle cheese evenly over one half. Add any veggies or herbs at this stage. Let it cook another 20–30 seconds on low heat — the cheese begins to melt while the bottom stays golden but not crisp.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Fold and Finish (Harmony of Heat and Form):</strong> Use a spatula to gently fold the omelette in half over the cheese. Press lightly to seal. Cook another 15–20 seconds so the cheese melts fully inside. Slide it onto a plate, let it rest for half a minute, and serve immediately.
<em>Optional:</em> sprinkle herbs or extra cheese on top for aroma and visual appeal.</li>
        </ul>
